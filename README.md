## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues in Production

> These issues are rare and do not affect core functionality.

- **Preload Warnings**: Assets are preloaded but not immediately used, triggered by automatic Next.js optimization.
- **400/500 Errors**: Can occur due to malformed image uploads or misconfigured paths, especially in production deployments.
- **ChunkLoadError**: May happen if the deployment cache is stale or the dynamic routes (like `[mealslug]`) fail to resolve correctly.
- **Favicon Not Found (404)**: The favicon file is missing or not linked in the HTML; this will be fixed in the next update.
- **Dynamic Route Failures on Vercel**: SQLite3 is a local file-based DB and does not persist on Vercel‚Äôs serverless environment unless configured carefully with workarounds (e.g., remote DB or edge-compatible storage).

## üõ†Ô∏è Development & Local Setup

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/foodies-blog.git
   
2. Install dependencies:
npm install

3. Run the development server:
npm run dev

4. Open http://localhost:3000

Meals are stored locally in meals.db inside your project directory.

## üåê Development Notes
‚ö†Ô∏è SQLite3 is file-based and not recommended for serverless environments like Vercel unless read-only or paired with persistent storage. You can still deploy the frontend and switch to a remote DB (e.g., Supabase, PlanetScale) for full functionality.
